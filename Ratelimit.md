## Goal : Limit how many time a client like IP or userID can call a specific API in a given time window

Perfect, Zen. Building a **rate-limit middleware** is a great challenge to grow as a backend dev. Let‚Äôs break it down step-by-step like a senior developer would:

---

## ‚úÖ Goal

Limit how many times a client (e.g., IP or user ID) can call a specific API in a given time window (e.g., 10 requests per minute).

---

## üß† Mental Model: **How to Design Rate Limiting**

### 1. **Identify the Limiting Strategy**

* IP-based (for anonymous clients)
* User-based (if authenticated)
* Per route or global?

### 2. **Choose a Storage**

* Needs fast read/write + TTL
* ‚úÖ In-memory (for dev/test): `dict`
* üîÅ Redis (for production): persistent, shared

### 3. **Define Rate Limit Rule**

* E.g., `5 requests / 60 seconds`
* Track:

  * Request count
  * Time window (or expiration timestamp)

### 4. **Middleware or Dependency?**

* **Middleware**: Applies globally
* **Depends()**: Allows per-route limits

We'll build a **middleware first** to learn the core logic.



### Common rate limiting algorithms 

1. Fixed Window
Idea count request in a fixed time block like 10 am to 11 am 
easy to implement use a counter and timestamp , but not exactly if traffic near window edges 

2. Sliding Window
Idea look at the last time not just the fixed time 
track : store timestamps of each request and count how many are within the last time window 
faier than fixed window  but slightly more memory and cpu because need to store timestamps
